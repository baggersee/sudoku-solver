# sudoku-solver
Implementation of a recursion algorithm to solve sudokus.

## Instructions of use:
* After running the main file 'sudoku_interface.py' a Tkinter window appears with a 9x9 board with empty sqaures.
* Once the default given numbers of the sudoku are introduced, press the 'Solve me' button and the remaining empty sqaures will be filled.
* To set up a new Sudoku fill again the default given squares and erase the other ones, or simply close the window and run again the code.

## Future improvements
* Implement better aesthetics in the Tkinter interface.
* Implement the possibility of setting up a new Sudoku directly by pressing space bar.
